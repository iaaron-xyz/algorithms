Algorithms implementation just for fun.

## Sorting Algorthms
| Algorithm  | Description | Languages  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Selection sort | Sorting algorithm with $O(n^2)$ time complexity. | Python, Julia, JS |
| Merge sort | Sorting algorithm with $O(n \log n)$ time complexity. | Python, Julia, JS |

## Search Algorithms
| Algorithm  | Description | Languages  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Binary Search | Efficient search algorithm with $O(log(n))$ time complexity. It requires previously sorted elements.| Python, Julia, JS |
## Computational Physics and Math algorithms
| Algorithm  | Description | Languages  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Fibonacci  | Generates the Fibonacci sequence using iterative and recursive methods | Python, Julia, JS |
| Calculating $\pi$ | Compute the $\pi$ number given $n$ terms using the Leibniz Formula. | Python |

## Miscellaneus Algorithms
| Algorithm  | Description | Languages  |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Compression  | Compress text strings using bit strings and recover the original data decompressing from bit strings to the original text string. | Python |
| Unbreakable Encryption  | This type of encryption is aone-time pad encryption. This method mixes the original piece of data with meaningless random dummy data in sush a way that both, the original and the dummy data are required to recover the original messsage. | Python |
