# Calculating $\pi$

In this algorithm pi ($\pi$) is calculated using the [Leibniz formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80) or also known as the **Madhava-Leibniz**, and alternating series to find $\pi$.
$$
1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{9}-\cdots = \frac{\pi}{4}
$$
